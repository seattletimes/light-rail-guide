PIONEER SQUARE STATION
 
Referred to as the “heart of old Seattle,” this historic neighborhood is known for its contemporary art galleries, quirky businesses, casual saloons and pubs, and growing foodie scene.
 
After originally landing at Alki in West Seattle, Seattle’s early pioneers made Pioneer Square a permanent settlement in 1852. Oddly, the park bearing the neighborhood’s name is a triangle rather than a square —and is home to a Tlingit totem pole with its own unique story, as well as an Iron Pergola, erected in 1909 as a waiting shelter for a cable car.
 
Turn-of-the-century light poles and architecturally gorgeous brick and terra cotta buildings abound, due in large part to the infamous Great Fire of 1899,  which was started by a glue pot boiling over. Following the fire, wooden buildings were banned and replaced with brick. The streets were simultaneously raised some 22 feet to help level the city, creating a hidden underground section of Seattle, now the site of daily tours. 
 
Standing sentinel over Pioneer Square is the elegant Smith Tower, once the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. It now has an observatory and speakeasy on the top floor.
