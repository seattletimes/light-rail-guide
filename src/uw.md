<div class="stop-title">University of Washington Station</div>

One of the newest of the light-rail stops, the University of Washington Station deposits travelers at the entrance to [Husky Stadium](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/special-reports/new-improved-husky-stadium-ready-to-shine/), a sports venue often said to have the best view in college football — Mount Rainier, draped in a snow blanket, frequently demands attention from the southeast, while some Husky fans “sailgate” from boats moored on Lake Washington.
 
There’s plenty to explore past the stadium, too.
 
Washington is consistently named one of country’s most beautiful campuses, with dozens of buildings built in Collegiate Gothic style, including the iconic [Suzzallo Library](http://www.lib.washington.edu/suzzallo) with its 35-foot-high stained-glass windows. In the spring, the campus becomes a regional destination with the university’s blooming cherry trees found concentrated in the Quad.
 
Museum opportunities also abound on the campus. Science geeks will enjoy the [Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture](http://www.burkemuseum.org/). Its collections span some 16 million artifacts, including a mammoth tusk and the world’s largest collection of spread bird wings. Art lovers can take in contemporary-focused art at the [Henry Art Museum](https://henryart.org/) with work created by Northwest talent, along with mixed-media and performance art. Be sure to visit [James Turrell’s “Skyspace”](http://www.seattletimes.com/photo-video/photography/mindful-meditation-at-the-henry-art-gallery/) on a sunny day for a surreal experience. A round chamber with an aperture in the ceiling, it can make a blue sky look oddly two-dimensional.
 
A quick jaunt south of the station takes pedestrians to the Montlake Bridge, overlooking the Montlake Cut, where crew teams can frequently be seen practicing for upcoming regattas, or competing for the [Windermere Cup](http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-huskies/the-eight-most-memorable-windermere-cup-rowing-races-in-huskies-history/) every April. And to the east, the U District serves students with rows of kitschy shops, restaurants and bars.
