ANGLE LAKE STATION
 
Passengers traveling the elevated 1.6-mile track south of the airport station are offered a sweeping view of the Olympic Mountain range to the west, Mount Rainier to the southeast and Angle Lake to the east.
 
Opened in September 2016, the Angle Lake Station is the newest stop on Sound Transitâ€™s Central Link Light Rail. This SeaTac neighborhood is largely residential, but [Angle Lake Park](http://www.ci.seatac.wa.us/index.aspx?page=144) is a short 10-minute walk away, offering visitors an opportunity to fish, swim or picnic. For the latter, picnic-goers can stock up at a Mexican restaurant or West African market near the station.
