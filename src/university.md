UNIVERSITY STREET STATION
 
The University Street Station serves the downtown financial district, and also provides easy access to some of downtown Seattle’s most notable arts and culture institutions.
 
The station has a direct entrance to Benaroya Hall, home of the Seattle Symphony. Founded in 1903, the Seattle Symphony often features classics like Dvorak, Beethoven and Bach; on a contemporary note, the group has also performed symphonic renditions of video-game music, a live soundtrack screening of “Psycho” and Sir Mix-A-Lot’s “Baby Got Back.”
 
Seattle Art Museum’s main collection is just a few blocks away from the University Street Station. Inside, visitors will find some of the institution’s more than 25,000 pieces originating from nearly every continent, and a distinguished collection of locally made Native American art.
 
Combine SAM with the Rem Koolhaas-designed Seattle Public Library, a few blocks south of the station, for an ideal rainy-day excursion.  The interior of the library is just as striking as the exterior: Light dances throughout the building’s 11 floors, and visitors will be mesmerized by some of the building’s bold colors, including a blood-red passage, and neon-yellow escalators.
 
Also nearby: The ornate Chinoiserie of the 5th Avenue Theatre; the hardworking kinetic sculpture Hammering Man; and the Seattle waterfront, home to Ivar’s, the Seattle Great Wheel and the Seattle Aquarium.
