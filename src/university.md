<span class="dropcap">T</span>he University Street Station serves the downtown financial district, and also provides easy access to some of downtown Seattle’s most notable arts and culture institutions.
 
The station has a direct entrance to Benaroya Hall, home of the Seattle Symphony. Founded in 1903, the [Seattle Symphony](http://www.seattlesymphony.org/) often features classics like Dvorak, Beethoven and Bach; on a contemporary note, the group has also performed symphonic renditions of video-game music, a live soundtrack screening of “Psycho” and [Sir Mix-A-Lot’s “Baby Got Back.”](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/sir-mix-a-lot-had-a-lot-of-fun-with-seattle-symphony/)
 
[Seattle Art Museum](http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/)’s main collection is just a few blocks away from the University Street Station. Inside, visitors will find some of the institution’s more than 25,000 pieces originating from nearly every continent, and a distinguished collection of locally made Native American art.
 
Combine SAM with the Rem Koolhaas-designed [Seattle Public Library](http://old.seattletimes.com/pacificnw/2004/0425/cover.html), a few blocks south of the station, for an ideal rainy-day excursion. The interior of the library is just as striking as the exterior: Light dances throughout the building’s 11 floors, and visitors will be mesmerized by some of the building’s bold colors, including a blood-red passage, and neon-yellow escalators.
 
Also nearby: The ornate Chinoiserie of the [5th Avenue Theatre](https://www.5thavenue.org/); the hardworking kinetic sculpture [Hammering Man](http://samblog.seattleartmuseum.org/2015/09/the-hammering-man-is-the-worker-in-all-of-us/); and the [Seattle waterfront](http://waterfrontseattle.org/), home to Ivar’s, the [Seattle Great Wheel](https://seattlegreatwheel.com/) and the [Seattle Aquarium](http://www.seattleaquarium.org/).
