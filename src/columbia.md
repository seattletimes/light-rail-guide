COLUMBIA CITY STATION

Brick and wood-framed buildings line Columbia City’s quaint historic business district on Rainier Avenue South. The neighborhood’s shops, restaurants and community spaces are a reflection of its diversity: you can find all kinds of food, from African to Hawaiian to Caribbean; get your hair braided in cornrows; or snag a ticket to a Latino film festival or opera preview. Coffee shops and breweries abound, and entertainment is offered nightly at Ark Lodge Cinemas, Columbia City Theater, Rainier Arts Center, the Royal Room and other venues. 
 
Columbia City is a short 5-minute walk from the station that bears its name. Close by are Columbia Park, an urban greenspace sandwiched between traditional Seattle bungalows and newer highrise apartments; the century-old Seattle Public Library’s Columbia Branch; Rainier Community Center; and Genesee Park and Playfield, with its sports fields and off-leash dog area. The Columbia City Farmer’s Market draws crowds every Wednesday to 37th Avenue South and South Edmunds Street from late spring to fall.
