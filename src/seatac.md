SEATAC/AIRPORT STATION

This station serves the rapidly growing Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and diverse suburb of SeaTac.
 
Travelers can experience Seattle and the region without ever stepping outside of the airport: local musicians perform live seven days a week; Puget Sound oysters and salmon are served in several concourses, along with some of the areaâ€™s beer and wine; and regional Native American art can be found throughout the terminals.
 
Beyond the airport, SeaTac offers a variety of restaurants that reflect its demographic makeup, including Thai, Japanese and Mexican cuisine. For travelers with an overnight layover, the restaurant 13 Coins serves a bucket of clams, smoked salmon eggs benedict and other menu items 24 hours a day.
