RAINIER BEACH STATION
 
Where Rainier Avenue meets Lake Washington, you’ll find the busy commercial and residential neighborhood of Rainier Beach.
 
Among the area’s attractions are a recently remodeled community center (with a family-friendly indoor pool) and branch library that serves patrons in many languages. Nearby Kubota Garden, an expansive, tranquil Japanese garden created in the late 1920s by Japanese immigrant Fujitaro Kubota, is home to a bamboo grove, koi-filled ponds and the picturesque Heart Bridge.
 
From there, you can take the short trek to Lake Washington’s Pritchard Island Beach, a park with sweeping views of Seward Park to the north and Mercer Island to the east, and a connected marsh with native plants and several animal species calling the wetland home.
 
And don’t miss Emerson School, an architectural and historic gem.  Built in 1909 in the Jacobean style, it was the first Seattle public school to have kindergarten.
