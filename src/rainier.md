<span class="dropcap">W</span>here Rainier Avenue meets Lake Washington, you’ll find the vibrant, diverse and residential neighborhood of Rainier Beach.

Among the area’s attractions are a recently remodeled [community center](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/centers/rainier-beach-community-center) (with a family-friendly indoor pool) and branch library that serves patrons in many languages. Nearby [Kubota Garden](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/kubota-garden), an expansive, tranquil Japanese garden created in the late 1920s by Japanese immigrant Fujitaro Kubota, is home to a bamboo grove, koi-filled ponds and the picturesque Heart Bridge.
 
From there, you can take the short trek to Lake Washington’s [Pritchard Island Beach](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/pritchard-island-beach), a park with sweeping views of Seward Park to the north and Mercer Island to the east, and a connected marsh with native plants and several animal species calling the wetland home. Adjacent to Pritchard Island Beach is [Beer Sheva Park](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/beer-sheva-park), which makes an ideal setting for a picnic, with the Cascade Mountains greeting visitors in the distance.

For those with an appetite, head to [Jude’s Old Town](https://www.facebook.com/JudesOldTown) or [Stonehouse Café and Bar](http://www.thestonehousecafe.com/) for sweet and savory food options, or a pint of beer. Or if you need a jolt of caffeine, enjoy Ethiopian coffee paired with the tasty and filling Kaffa combo at [Kaffa Coffee & Wine Bar](http://www.kaffacoffee.net/p/welcome.html).
 
And don’t miss [Emerson School](http://emersones.seattleschools.org/), an architectural and historic gem. Built in 1909 in the Jacobean style, it was the first Seattle public school to have kindergarten.
