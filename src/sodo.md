SODO STATION
 
Passengers entering SoDo Station should crane their necks to observe the massive, colorful murals adorning warehouse exteriors – the artwork is part of the growing SODO Track project. When completed, murals from some 50 artists will spread over 32 walls.
 
SoDo is almost entirely an industrial and factory district. The area was originally named for being South of the former Mariners stadium, the Kingdome. The Mariners also popularized the slogan “SoDo Mojo” in the early 2000s.
 
About a 10-minute walk from the SoDo Station is the colorful Old Rainier Brewery, adorned with an iconic “R” that can be seen from Interstate 5.
 
For rabid Starbucks fanatics, the company’s world headquarters is a half-mile jaunt to the west of SoDo Station. Formal tours aren’t usually given, but anyone can visit the Coffee Gear Store on the eighth floor for items that aren’t found in most stores.

Other stops on a Seattle insider’s tour might include Emerald City Trapeze Arts, which offers circus-arts classes and weekend performances; the Orient Express Restaurant and Lounge, a funky, unique restaurant created from former railroad cars; an unofficial “green light district,” with several legal cannabis shops like Cannabis City and Ganja Goddess within walking distance; and the Marginal Way Skatepark, a concrete bowl-shaped park underneath the Alaskan Way Viaduct.
