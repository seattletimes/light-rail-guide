TUKWILA INTERNATIONAL BOULEVARD STATION
 
The Tukwila International Boulevard Station is located in the most diverse city in the Pacific Northwest.  At nearby Foster High School, more than 40 world languages are spoken, and flags from about 50 countries greet students in the cafeteria. Tukwilaâ€™s diversity is also illustrated through the many businesses found near the station.  At nearby Bakaro Mall, a wide range of African-made products is sold, including fabrics, jewelry and beauty products.  Global cuisine is also found in the shadows of the station, including Indian, Chinese, East African and Mexican food.
 
A quick bus ride from the Tukwila station is Westfield Southcenter mall.  At 1.7 million square feet, it is the largest shopping complex in the state, with more than 200 stores. Dozens of additional retailers and restaurants, large and small, anchor the periphery of the mall.
 
For bike and hiking enthusiasts, the Green River Trail is about a 15-minute trip from the station. The approximately 20-mile trail hugs the Green River, traversing farmland, industrial and warehouse areas, and suburbs, ending in Seattle.
